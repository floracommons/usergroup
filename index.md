# Welcome to the Canadian Flora Commons user group

James Macklin’s group at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is developing an online flora of the plants of Canada by integrating existing Canadian flora resources and enhancing content via a trait data query tool. We envision the online flora as a community space for discussion and collaboration.
 
To realize our vision, we need help from our intended audience! Would you be interested in joining quarterly Zoom calls to see our progress and provide feedback? Please join us!

We know that for this resource (we’ve called it the “Canadian Flora Commons”) to be useful, we need continued feedback and engagement from our intended users.

Join us at our user group meetings!
